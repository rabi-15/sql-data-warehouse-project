# 🚀 MySQL Data Warehouse Project

## Project Overview

This project is a modern, end-to-end Data Warehouse built completely from scratch using **MySQL**. It applies best practices in data engineering and database design to ingest, clean, transform, and organize data for advanced analytics and business intelligence.

The architecture follows the **Medallion pattern** , organizing data into three refined layers for scalable and modular data processing:

* **Bronze Layer:** Raw data ingestion from source systems as-is.
* **Silver Layer:** Cleaned and standardized data for quality and consistency.
* **Gold Layer:** Business-ready star schema models with analytical views and KPIs.

## ✨ Features & Highlights

* Fully designed and developed in **MySQL**.
* **Robust ELT stored procedures** automate data ingestion and transformations.
* Optimized **indexing and foreign key constraints** ensure data integrity and query performance.
* Use of advanced MySQL features like **generated columns**, transactions, and error handling.
* Comprehensive **data quality validation** scripts.
* Insightful analytical views on customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and business metrics.
