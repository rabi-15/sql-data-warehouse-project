Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!

MySQL Data Warehouse Project
Project Overview
This project is a modern, end-to-end Data Warehouse built completely from scratch using MySQL. It applies best practices in data engineering and database design to ingest, clean, transform, and organize data for advanced analytics and business intelligence.

The architecture follows the Medallion pattern, organizing data into three refined layers for scalable and modular data processing:

Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from source systems as-is.

Silver Layer: Cleaned and standardized data for quality and consistency.

Gold Layer: Business-ready star schema models with analytical views and KPIs.

Features & Highlights
Fully designed and developed in MySQL.

Robust ETL stored procedures automate data ingestion and transformations.

Optimized indexing and foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity and query performance.

Use of advanced MySQL features like generated columns, transactions, and error handling.

Comprehensive data quality validation scripts.

Insightful analytical views on customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and business metrics.

Clear documentation explaining architecture, design decisions, and usage.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
MySQL Server 8.0 or later

MySQL Workbench or any MySQL client tool

Basic knowledge of SQL and data warehousing concepts

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mysql-data-warehouse-project
Create the database and schema:

sql
SOURCE scripts/00_setup/create_database.sql;
Create and load Bronze layer tables:

sql
SOURCE scripts/bronze/ddl_bronze_tables.sql;
SOURCE scripts/bronze/proc_load_bronze.sql;
CALL load_bronze_layer();
Create and load Silver layer tables:

sql
SOURCE scripts/silver/ddl_silver_tables.sql;
SOURCE scripts/silver/proc_load_silver.sql;
CALL load_silver_layer();
Create Gold layer views:

sql
SOURCE scripts/gold/create_gold_views.sql;
Run data quality checks:

sql
SOURCE tests/data-quality-checks.sql;
Usage & Analytics
Query the Gold layer views for business insights.

Schedule ETL stored procedures for automated pipeline runs.

Monitor data quality reports regularly to maintain accuracy.

Design Decisions
Modular design for scalability and maintainability.

Use of InnoDB for reliable ACID compliance and foreign key support.

Leveraged generated columns for calculated fields, improving query simplicity.

Normalized Silver layer reduces data redundancy.

Star schema structure in Gold layer optimizes analytical queries.

Skills Demonstrated
Designing and implementing a data warehouse architecture from scratch.

Developing complex ETL logic using MySQL stored procedures.

Managing data integrity with foreign keys and constraints.

Data quality validation and handling error checks.

Creating analytical models and business KPIs with SQL views.

Writing professional documentation for technical projects.
